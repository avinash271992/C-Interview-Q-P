****A pointer to a const value is a (non-const) pointer that points to a constant value.

To declare a pointer to a const value, use the const keyword before the data type:

Wrong way
const int value = 5; // value is const
int *ptr = &value; // compile error: cannot convert const int* to int*
*ptr = 6; // change value to 6

Correct wat to declare pointer to a const variable
onst int value = 5;
const int *ptr = &value; // this is okay, ptr is a non-const pointer that is pointing to a "const int"
*ptr = 6; // not allowed, we can't change a const value

Q #10) What is the difference between ++d and d++?

Ans) ‘++d”  is called prefixed increment and the increment will happen first on a variable. ‘d++’ is called
postfix increment and the increment happens after the value of a variable used for the operations.

******Q #14) Describe the header file and its usage in C programming?

Ans) The file contains the definitions and prototypes of the functions being used in the program are called a 
header file. It is also known as a library file.

Example– The header file contains commands like printf and scanf is the stdio.h.

Q #23) What is the method to save data in stack data structure type?

Ans) Data is stored in Stack data structure type using First in Last out (FILO) mechanism.
Only top of the stack is accessible at a given instance. Storing mechanism is referred as a PUSH and retrieve is referred 
as a POP.

Q #30) Describe the modifier in C?

Ans) Modifier is a prefix to the basic data type which is used to indicate the modification for
storage space allocation to a variable.

Example– In 32-bit processor storage space for int data type is 4.When we use it with modifier the storage 
space change as follows.

Long int -> Storage space is 8 bit
Short int -> Storage space is 2 bit
